## Motivation

I developed this **Personal Mood Tracker** as my project to create a tool that helps people monitor and understand their emotional well-being. Having experienced the benefits of mood tracking myself, I wanted to build an application that not only records moods but also provides insights and patterns through data visualization. The integration of AI-powered suggestions adds a supportive element to help users maintain positive mental health.

**Note on API Key:**  
The OpenAI API key used in this project is funded with minimal credit and for demonstration purposes only. I am aware of the security risks and have implemented appropriate safeguards.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Data Directory

- **Error:** 
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data/mood_data.csv'

- **Solution:**  
The application will automatically create the `data` directory and `mood_data.csv` file on first run. If it fails, manually create a `data` folder in the project directory.

### CSV File Corruption

- **Issue:**  
Data file becomes corrupted or unreadable.

- **Solution:**  
Delete the existing `mood_data.csv` file and restart the application. It will create a new file automatically.

### OpenAI API Issues

- **Error:**  
`InvalidRequestError` or other API-related errors.

- **Solution:**  
This shouldn't happen unless my special account is not funded anymore. I gave it more than enough (over 1500 requests). Please contact me otherwise or use own API key (execution costs below 1c)
