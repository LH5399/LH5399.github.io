A friend of mine always asks me, what do you do and so does my grandmum every time I visit her. They can look up my LinkedIn Account or a Company Webpage, but we all have more to offer than our current profession or the university from which we got our degree.
As of writing this, I am currently 24 and pursuing my Master's at HSG. I'm doing the MacFin (Master in Accounting and Finance) + a new Fintech Certificate Program. Jobwise I am a Junior Consultant at Prophet (or call Working Student if you want to :D). We do Strategy Consulting and I enjoy working with diverse companies and clients in the DACH industry. Over the years I developed a preference for the construction industry. I feel like you can make a very big influence in this industry because it has to evolve to meet the world of the future. Furthermore, my grandfather, who passed away before I was born, also worked in the construction industry for his entire life. When I told my father, that I developed a preference for this industry, his eyes lit up in a way that I will never forget. This fact motivates me often when i finish my work or some university assignment.  

If you enjoy the content I share here, I would be happy to get some feedback. My current plans for the page:

- some computer science exercise videos (thanks to ChatGPT i dont get paid to do that anymore)
- thoughts on some books
- showcase some past projects from uni and personal ones
- perspectives
- life updates
- and maybe some excel/ppt tips and tricks, if it gets requested



Thanks for reading!
